>Chihuahua, Great Dane, Golden Retriever, Poodle, Newfoundland, Austrian Guildenbaur

A:
Chihuaha: This is a small dog so most people would be able to control it (Smaller work size).  But, small dogs are usually wild (high complexity). So, I'll assign this card an M (medium).
Great Dane: This is a large dog and a very powerful dog, so this is an XL (extra-large)
Golden Retriever: This is a medium sized dog but a relatively well behaved and not too powerful dog. This
gets an S.
Poodle: I need to more information about this dog.  Is it small or large?
Newfoundland: I need more information about this dog's behavior patterns.  I think it's a big dog, but I'm not sure.
Austrian Guildenbaur: I need more information about this dog.  I know absolutely nothing about it except from its name.
