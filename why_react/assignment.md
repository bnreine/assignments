#### Questions

> In your own words, explain single-page applications and progressive web apps.

A: A single page application (SPA) either loads all resources (html, css, javascript, images) necessary for the entire website all at once, then updates as needed as the user navigates to other pages on the site or the site requests additional info in the background as needed.  Basically, you don't reload entire pages each time you click on something or change pages within a site.  Progressive web apps (PWA) are web applications that load well on weak or non-existent internet connections, send push notifications, and give great user experience similar to applications on a mobile or desktop device.

> Either from your research or by inspecting popular sites you frequent (using the Chrome DevTools), give some real-world examples of applications built with React and Angular.

A:
React: facebook, yahoo, codecademy
Angular: Paypal, upwork, netflix

> Write a summary of the benefits of React vs. Angular. Then ask your mentor about the current state of web development, and ask questions about how they use these two popular technologies in their work.

A:

React-->
* React runs faster than Angular2
* Lower learning curve
* Catches errors at compile, not runtime like with Angular2
* Minimalist in out-of-box components.
* Can choose uni/bi directional Flow
* Manages transactional state
* JSX easier to learn than Angular2 templates
* "Flow" in React is more flexible (on/off) than "typescript" in Angular2
* Can make truly native apps using React Native.
* Material IU in React is more mature and more components than with Material Design of Angular2
* Server side rendering with Next.js
* Choose between Redux (complex apps) and MobX (simple apps) depending on app complexity.


Angular2-->
* More built-in components
* Can choose uni/bi directional Flow
* Manages transactional state
* Better for continuous flow of data apps
* Can make hybrid mobile/web apps with ionic
