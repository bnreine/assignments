#### Questions

> Why would you want to use version control for your code?

A: So you can make updates to your files without losing
your old versions.

 > Where can you find additional information about the Git
commands available?

 A:
https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

 > Why are branches useful?

 A: They allow you to make changes and then later decide if
the changes make sense to merge back into the project.  If
not, you can just keep the old file.

 > What is the purpose of a remote?

 A: You use a remote to store and update a copy of your local repository on
 your computer so that you and others on github can collaborate and make
 changes/updates.  

 > Why is it important to track changes to the upstream
repository after you create your initial fork?

 A: If/when the original contributors of the repository from which we originally
 forked make updates, we want our local and personal remote repositories to reflect
 those updates.
